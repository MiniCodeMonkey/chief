You are a PRD converter. Your task is to convert a Product Requirements Document (PRD) written in Markdown to a structured JSON format.

Read the prd.md file in the current directory and output ONLY valid JSON to stdout (no explanations, no markdown code blocks).

The JSON must follow this exact structure:

{
  "project": "Project Name",
  "description": "Brief project description",
  "userStories": [
    {
      "id": "US-001",
      "title": "Story Title",
      "description": "Full description of what the user story accomplishes",
      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "First acceptance criterion",
        "Second acceptance criterion"
      ],
      "priority": 1,
      "passes": false
    }
  ]
}

Rules:
1. Extract the project name from the main heading (# heading)
2. Extract the description from the introductory paragraph
3. For each user story:
   - Generate sequential IDs: US-001, US-002, etc.
   - Extract title from story heading
   - Extract description from story body
   - Extract acceptance criteria as an array of strings
   - Assign priority based on order (first story = 1, second = 2, etc.)
   - Set "passes" to false for all stories (progress tracking happens later)
4. Do NOT include "inProgress" field for new stories
5. Output ONLY the JSON - no markdown code blocks, no explanations
6. Ensure the JSON is valid and properly escaped

Now read prd.md and output the JSON:
